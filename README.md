# Another-DB-Gamemode

Drunks based Game Mode for Demon Bluff.
Press 'V' after opening a game in Endless mode.

This gamemode supposedly takes place inside a tavern, with 18 cards split into 3 groups of 6. (Tables are #1 - #6, #7 - #12, #13 - #18).
This mode is really hard. Good luck.

## Special roles

There are 2 special roles for this Game Mode.

### Bartender (Good/Outcast)
The Bartender does not appear naturally. Instead, one Villager gains the Bartender status. The Bartender cannot be be Corrupted or affected by Evils.

Villagers at a Bartender's table become corrupted, while Evils at that table must tell the truth and register as Corrupted.

### Tavernkeeper (Good/Outcast)
Tells you how many characters are Corrupted.

(Currently uses Baa's sprite. It's not evil, it's just a placeholder sprite.)

## Extra non-minion roles

### Waiter (Good/Villager)
States how many Corrupted characters are at his table.

### Chef (Good/Villager)
Learn how many Evils sit at each table, but not which number belongs to which table.

### Beer Thrower (Evil/Demon)
Corrupts a random Villager and Evil not at the Bartender's table. He Corrupts a second Villager if no Evils are available.

## Extra minions

### Strategist (Evil/Minion)
Swaps places with a random Minion when you attempt to Execute him.

### Florist (Evil/Minion)
Prevents one random good Villager's active ability from being used.

### Gangster (Evil/Minion)
Kills one adjacent face-down Good character at Night, dealing 2 damage. 

### Brewer (Evil/Minion)
Counts as Corrupted and always tells the Truth.

### Summoner (Evil/Minion)
Copies the abilities of the nearest Evil.

### Trickster (Evil/Minion)
